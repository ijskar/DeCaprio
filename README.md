# DeCaprio
This repository contains the code for reproducing experiments found in our paper:
*Bleukx I, Berden S et al. (2022): Model-based algorithm configuration with adaptive capping and prior distributions, CPAIOR 2022*

## Overview of the code
Different scoring functions are implemented to work with the our DeCaprio algorithm based on SMBO with adaptive cappig.
The code is structured as follows:

```bash

```

An instance of a Scorer is used to rank all parameter configurations based on previous knowledge during the search. <br>
The output of both experiment files comparing scorers is a dataframe for every model. These dataframes contain the tested configuration in order during the search. For convenience, the dataframe also contains metadata of the search itself such as wallclock time and the runtime of a tested configuration.


## Getting the data
To speedup experiments found in this repository, we used cached runtimes for all models and configurations.
All configuration were timed out on 105% of the default runtime.
These can be found via the following dropbox link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/w4dn19p31cg7g5r/grid_search.pickle?dl=1

The data is structured as a pandas dataframe and contains the runtime for every configuration on every model found in [cpmpy_models/](/cpmpy_models)

All runtimes were obtained using an Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4214 CPU with the number of thread per model limited to 1.
For every model/parameter configuration, 5 seperate runs of the OR-tools solver were performed.

Every configuration is assigned an id based on the parameter values it contains. To convert from config ids to actual parameter configuraions, use the helper functions found in [utils.py](/utils.py)
